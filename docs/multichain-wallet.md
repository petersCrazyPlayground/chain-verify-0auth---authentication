# Multi-Chain Wallet Documentation

## Introduction
The Multi-Chain Wallet is a smart contract system that allows users to manage their digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. Think of it as a universal wallet that can hold and manage different types of cryptocurrencies and tokens from various blockchains, all in one place.

## Key Features

### 1. Cross-Chain Asset Management
- **What it does**: Allows you to hold and manage assets from different blockchains
- **How it works**: Uses bridge contracts to represent assets from other chains
- **Example**: You can hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana tokens in the same wallet

### 2. Secure Key Management
- **What it does**: Safely stores and manages your private keys
- **How it works**: Uses advanced encryption and security protocols
- **Security features**:
  - Multi-signature support
  - Time-locked transactions
  - Recovery mechanisms

### 3. Transaction Management
- **What it does**: Handles sending and receiving assets across chains
- **How it works**: Uses bridge contracts to facilitate transfers
- **Features**:
  - Cross-chain transfers
  - Transaction history
  - Gas optimization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Familiarity with cryptocurrency wallets
- Access to supported blockchain networks

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/contracts.git
cd contracts/core/multichain-wallet
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage Guide

### Creating a New Wallet
```solidity
// Example using the wallet contract
const wallet = await Wallet.deploy();
await wallet.initialize();
```

### Managing Assets
```solidity
// Adding a new asset
await wallet.addAsset("ETH", "0x...");

// Transferring assets
await wallet.transfer("ETH", "0x...", "1000000000000000000");
```

### Security Features
```solidity
// Setting up multi-signature
await wallet.setupMultiSig(3, ["0x...", "0x...", "0x..."]);

// Time-locked transaction
await wallet.scheduleTransfer("ETH", "0x...", "1000000000000000000", 7 days);
```

## Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure
```
MultiChainWallet.sol
├── AssetManagement.sol
├── Security.sol
├── BridgeIntegration.sol
└── Utils.sol
```

### Key Components
1. **Asset Registry**
   - Tracks all supported assets
   - Manages asset metadata
   - Handles asset conversions

2. **Security Module**
   - Manages access control
   - Handles key management
   - Implements security features

3. **Bridge Interface**
   - Connects to various bridges
   - Manages cross-chain transfers
   - Handles bridge-specific logic

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Key Management**
   - Never share private keys
   - Use hardware wallets when possible
   - Implement multi-signature for large holdings

2. **Transaction Security**
   - Verify all transaction details
   - Use time-locks for large transfers
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

3. **Asset Security**
   - Verify asset contracts
   - Check bridge security
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Transaction Failures**
   - Check gas limits
   - Verify network status
   - Ensure sufficient funds

2. **Asset Issues**
   - Verify asset contract
   - Check bridge status
   - Confirm asset support

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Check access controls
   - Verify signatures
   - Monitor for anomalies
