# Cross-Chain Bridge Documentation

## Introduction
Cross-chain bridges are like digital highways that connect different blockchain networks. They allow assets and data to move between different blockchains, enabling interoperability in the decentralized world. This documentation explains how our bridge system works and how to use it.

## Understanding Bridges

### What is a Bridge?
A bridge is a system that allows:
- Transfer of tokens between different blockchains
- Communication between different networks
- Interoperability between different protocols

### How Bridges Work
1. **Lock and Mint**
   - Assets are locked on the source chain
   - Equivalent tokens are minted on the destination chain

2. **Burn and Unlock**
   - Tokens are burned on the destination chain
   - Original assets are unlocked on the source chain

3. **Verification**
   - Validators verify transactions
   - Security checks are performed
   - Consensus is reached

## Supported Bridges

### 1. SKALE-Bitcoin Bridge
- **Purpose**: Connect SKALE and Bitcoin networks
- **Features**:
  - Secure custody of Bitcoin
  - Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on SKALE
  - Fast transaction processing

### 2. Avalanche-SKALE Bridge
- **Purpose**: Connect Avalanche and SKALE networks
- **Features**:
  - Cross-chain token transfers
  - Secure verification
  - Low transaction fees

### 3. Solana Bridges
- **Purpose**: Connect Solana with other networks
- **Features**:
  - High-speed transactions
  - Low-cost transfers
  - Native token support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Access to supported networks
- Required tokens for gas fees

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/contracts.git
cd contracts/bridges
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage Guide

### Transferring Tokens
```solidity
// Example: Transfer tokens from SKALE to Bitcoin
const bridge = await Bridge.deploy();
await bridge.lockTokens("SKALE", "1000000000000000000");
await bridge.mintTokens("BITCOIN", "1.0");
```

### Verifying Transactions
```solidity
// Check transaction status
const status = await bridge.getTransactionStatus(txHash);
console.log("Transaction status:", status);

// Verify bridge security
const security = await bridge.checkSecurity();
console.log("Security status:", security);
```

## Architecture

### Bridge Components
```
BridgeSystem/
├── LockContract.sol
├── MintContract.sol
├── Validator.sol
└── Security.sol
```

### Key Features
1. **Security Layer**
   - Multi-signature verification
   - Time-locked transactions
   - Emergency shutdown

2. **Validation System**
   - Transaction verification
   - Consensus mechanism
   - Fraud detection

3. **Asset Management**
   - Token wrapping
   - Balance tracking
   - Fee calculation

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Before Transferring**
   - Verify bridge security
   - Check network status
   - Confirm token support

2. **During Transfer**
   - Monitor transaction status
   - Keep transaction receipts
   - Watch for confirmations

3. **After Transfer**
   - Verify received tokens
   - Check destination wallet
   - Save transaction details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Transaction Stuck**
   - Check network congestion
   - Verify gas settings
   - Contact support if needed

2. **Token Issues**
   - Verify token contract
   - Check bridge status
   - Confirm token support

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Report suspicious activity
   - Check bridge security
   - Monitor for updates
