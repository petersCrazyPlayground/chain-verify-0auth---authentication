# Cross-Chain Bridge Contracts

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of smart contracts and tools for building cross-chain bridges between different blockchain networks. These bridges enable the transfer of assets and data between various blockchains, making it possible to create truly interoperable decentralized applications.

### What is a Cross-Chain Bridge?
A cross-chain bridge is a technology that allows the transfer of assets or data between different blockchain networks. Think of it like a bridge between two islands - it enables people and goods to move between them. In the blockchain world, these bridges allow tokens and data to move between different blockchain networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Familiarity with smart contract development

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/contracts.git
cd contracts
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Core Components

### Multi-Chain Wallet
The multi-chain wallet is a smart contract that enables users to manage assets across multiple blockchain networks. It provides:
- Cross-chain asset management
- Secure key management
- Transaction signing
- Asset tracking

### Bridge Implementations
We support several bridge implementations:

1. **SKALE-Bitcoin Bridge**
   - Enables token transfers between SKALE and Bitcoin
   - Features secure custody and verification
   - Supports wrapped Bitcoin tokens

2. **Avalanche-SKALE Bridge**
   - Connects Avalanche and SKALE networks
   - Supports cross-chain token transfers
   - Implements secure verification mechanisms

3. **Solana Bridges**
   - Various bridges connecting Solana to other networks
   - Support for Solana's unique architecture
   - High-performance transaction processing

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment
1. Install development tools:
```bash
npm install -g hardhat
npm install -g @project-serum/anchor
```

2. Configure your development environment:
```bash
# For Hardhat projects
npx hardhat compile

# For Solana projects
anchor build
```

### Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## Security Considerations
- All contracts are audited by third-party security firms
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow best practices for key management
- Regular security updates and patches
